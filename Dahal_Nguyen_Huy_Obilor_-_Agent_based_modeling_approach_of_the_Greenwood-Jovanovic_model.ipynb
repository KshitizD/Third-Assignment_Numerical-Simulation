    "### ABSTRACT\n",
    "This is a simulation of Greenwood-Jovanovic Model which made an important contribution to the field of Economics by laying out the path of financial development, economic growth, and distribution of income. It predicted that income gap widens in the initial phase of financial development, but this gap slowly subsides as economy advances along with advancement in financial intermediation, and eventually the economy converges to a higher level of growth with a stable level of income distribution. We follow an agent-based modeling approach implemented in Python 2.7 to simulate the financial development model described above. The aim of the simulation is to generate a time path of the average wealth, inequality, growth rate and development of the intermediary. We expect these time paths to reflect the predictions of the analytical model. We implement codes to define individuals as well as financial intermediary as objects. We also use the iteration process on the Bellman-equation by tailoring the codes implemented in Python by Sargent and Stachursky (2014). In order to analyse the time path of inequality in the economy, we rely on a function that produces the Gini-coefficient derived from Aaron Schumacher (2013). In order to obtain realistic results, we assumed a set of parameters for the model. Then we were able to simulate the dynamics of the economic environment where individuals decide whether to join the intermediary or not based on the parameters entered. Finally we calculate the growth rate path, inequality path, and the path traced by financial intermediary-thus efficiently simulating Greenwood-Jovanovic Model. We also provide plots for our results for easy analysis."

    "## MOTIVATION\n",
    "The motivation behind the simulation is to generate a time path of the average wealth, inequality, growth rate and development of the intermediary sector. Given a great deal of current interest in rising inequality as well as the importance attached to financial sectors, we believe this to be an important topic to simulate. Although the above mentioned questions could have been answered by analytically solving the model as well, the implementation of this simulation model has an added advantage in that it allows the analysis of further questions. For example, one of the proposed mechanism to lower the cost of access to financial intermediary is the provision of subsidies. But what would be the source of funding of such subsidy? Further expanding the simulation model would allow us to analyse the effect of a progressive tax or a tax on investment income produced by the financial intermediary. A tax on investment income would reduce the returns from the intermediary thus reducing the life-time expected benefit from the intermediary. Ironically, this could counteract the intended effect of subsidy, which is to enable earlier access to the intermediary."

    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This model proposed by Jeremy Greenwood and Boyan Jovanovic presents the transition of a primitive slow-growing economy to a developed fast growing one through a development in the level and quality of financial intermediation. In short, it traces the path of financial development, economic growth, and distribution of income. The model is based on the assumption that institutions arise endogenously to facilitate trade. These intermediaries because of their advantage on colecting and analyzing information allow for optimal flow of investors' resources. The economy grows along with development of these financial intermediaries in a Kuznet curve resembling pattern. In the initial stages, an economy lacks any financial structure or is nonexistent and hence grows very slowly. As the economy approaches intermediate stage, financial structures start to develop. This stage is marked by increased growth and saving rates, but with a wider distribution of income across the rich and the poor. Finally, the economy matures and develops an extensive structure for financial intermediation. In this stage, the distribution of income becomes stable, the savings rate falls, and the economy's growth rate converges to a higher level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Theoretical background of the model \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I. The Economic Environment\n",
    "The model considers an economy populated by a continuum of agents  distributed over the interval [0,1]. Thus, each individual is represented by an index j,  $ j \\in [0,1] $. \n",
    "An agent's goal is maximizes his expected lifetime utility which is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    E \\left[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\beta^t ln c_t \\right] \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "with $0<\\beta<1$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $ c_t $ is agent's period t consumption flow and $\\beta$ the discount factor\n",
    "There are two types of one-period production projects. The first one is **safe**, but has a relatively low return on investment, and the second one offers a higher (unconditional) expected return but is more **risky**. The two projects are given by the following equations:-\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safe Project**\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    y_{it} = \\delta x_{it}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Here, an investment $x_{it}$ yields $\\delta x_{it}$ units of output where $\\delta$ is a technological constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risky Project**\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    y_{it} = (\\theta_t + \\epsilon_{it})x_{it}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where, $(\\theta_t + \\epsilon_{it})$  represents a composite technology shock, $\\theta_t$ being the aggregate shock (common across both technologies) and $\\epsilon_{it}$ being the idiosyncratic shock (project-specific shock) with $E[\\epsilon_{it} = 0]$. It is to be noted that an agent can costlessly observe only the realized composite rate of return  $(\\theta_t + \\epsilon_{it})$ on his own project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the model assumes that at the beginning of each period t, an agent will be endowed with a certain amount of wealth, $k_t$ that can be consumed or invested in either safe or risky production projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### II. Competitive Financial Intermediation\n",
    "\n",
    "As the economy starts to grow from its primitive stage, a subset of agents establish networks to provide financial intermediation activities for some larger set of individuals. They charge competitive fees for their intermediation services.\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce that aspect of competitive financial intermediation, the model supposes that some individuals in period t have assumed the role of being an intermediary , which is represented by $\\mathbb{A_{t}}\\in [0,1]$. It is also supposed that they bear a cost of $\\alpha$ for joining the intermediary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the model assumes that in exchange for a once-and-for-all fee of q along with the rights to operate an individual's project, the intermediary promises a return of $r(\\theta_{t+j})$ per unit of capital invested in any period t+j-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the goal of the intermediary is to maximize profits, it will adopt the most efficient scheme possible for intermediation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Financial Intermediary's Scheme\n",
    "To maximize the profits, financial intermediary draws a finite number of projects, $\\tau $, from the portfolio of individual projects to research aggregate productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the aggregate amount of capital that the intermediary has to invest in time period t is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\hat{k} = \\frac {\\int_A k_j d\\lambda(j)} {\\int_A d\\lambda(j)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The intermediary then calculates the average net realized rate of return, $\\hat{\\theta_{\\tau}}$, on these projects, which is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\hat{\\theta_\\tau} = \\theta + \\sum_{j=o}^{\\tau} \\epsilon_j / \\tau\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "So, if the test statistic, $\\hat{\\theta_\\tau} > \\delta$, then all the remaining high-risk/return projects operated by intermediary are funded with $\\hat{k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, if $\\hat{\\theta_\\tau} < \\delta$, the intermediary invests its resources in safe projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the net return, $z(\\theta_t,\\hat{\\theta})$ behaves in a way such that:\n",
    "as $\\tau\\to\\infty, z\\to max(\\delta, \\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the intermediary repays $r(z)k_{j}$ to individual j who joined intermediary; r(z) is determined endogenously as a function of z.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, according to this model, the main benefits from financial intermediation are:-\n",
    "\n",
    "* intermediaries produce information about the aggregate state of the economy\n",
    "* intermediaries enable pooling of cross-sectional risk\n",
    "* \"intermediaries offer agents a rate of return on their investment that is (i)completely devoid of idiosyncratic production risk and (ii) safe-guarded from the potential losses that could occur when the aggregate return on the risky technology falls below the opportunity cost of the resources commited\"\n",
    "* intermediaries enable optimal allocation of resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. Market Participation\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all agents join the intermediation. Particularly, for some agents, it might be too costly for some agents to pay a lump-sum fee of $\\alpha$, and hence not worthwhile to gain access to the intermediation technology. Thus, outcomes of agents are determined by whether they join intermediation or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If s be the individual savings, then return to an agent outside of the intermediated sector is given by the outcome of following dynamic programming problem:- \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    W(k) = \\max_{0 \\leq s \\leq k} \\left[ ln(k-s) + \\beta \\int max\\left(W[s(\\theta+\\varepsilon)],V[s(\\theta+\\varepsilon)-\\alpha]\\right) dF(\\theta) dG(\\varepsilon) \\right]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the return to an agent who joins the intermediary is given by the outcome of following dynamic programming problem:-\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    V(k) = \\max_{0 \\leq s \\leq k} \\left[ \\ln (k-s) + \\beta \\int max\\left(W[s\\cdot max(\\delta,\\theta)],V[s \\cdot max(\\delta,\\theta)]\\right) dF(\\theta) \\right]\n",
    "\\end{equation}.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### III. Predictions/Results of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "(i). V(k) > W(k) for all k\n",
    "\n",
    "The model predicts that agents get a higher expected return in the intermediated sector, all the while enjoying less risk. This implies that agents do not exit the financial intermediary sector, which in turn implies, \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    V(k) = \\max_{0 \\leq s \\leq k} \\left[ \\ln (k-s) + \\beta \\int V[s \\cdot max(\\delta,\\theta)] dF(\\theta) \\right]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "This gives a solution for the individual saving as $s=\\beta k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii). There exists $\\bar{k}$ and $\\overline{k}$ with $0<\\bar{k}< \\overline{k}$ such that:\n",
    "* $ W(k) > V(k-\\alpha)$ for $0<k<\\bar{k}$\n",
    "* $ W(k) < V(k-\\alpha)$ for $k>\\bar{k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "What this implies is that at low income level ($k_{j}<\\bar{k}$), the individual j is better off not participating in the intermediated sector given his inability to cover the fixed cost\n",
    "\n",
    "However, at a higher level of income ($k_j > \\overline{k}$) the fixed cost is insignificant and individual j is better off in the intermediated sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model thus basically explains the initial widening income gap as some people can join the intermediated sector and some can not. It also shows that rich economies grow faster than poor countries.\n",

A clear improvement of the whole model would be the change in the estimation of the $v(k)$ value function to produce the right value and policy functions. Since we do not have correct simulation results but we do want to address our motivation, the draw some conclusions on the expected results that are based on the analytical solution of the theoretical model.\n",

    "The analytical solution of the model implies important conclusions for developing countries. If we assume that developing and developed countries differ in their initial wealth and thus their ability to join the financial intermediary in early periods, then by decreasing the cost of access to financial intermediation, it is possible to improve growth in expected term. With financial intermediation and its capability of sampling, the economy can channel its capital to the most productive projects available in each period (safe-risky). This allows the economy to reach the stage of development which could have been presented in the later stages of the simulations. This means on average higher expected growth rates with lower volatility and stable inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of inequality, the we expected an inverse U-curve time path with the Gini-index stabilising at a higher level than initial value. If the cost of access to the financial intermediary is lowered, then the early increase in the Gini-index causing in higher stable inequality can be avoided, so not only stable inequality, but a stability at a lower level (compared to the counterfactual) could be established.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is true that these conclusions can be derived from the analytical solution from the theoretical model as well, the implementation of this simulation model allows the analysis of further questions. For example, one of the obvious method lowering the cost of access is the provision of subsidy for households/individuals who can not afford them. But what would be the source of funding of such subsidy? Further expanding the simulation model would allow us to analyse the effect of a progressive tax or a tax on investment income produced by the financial intermediary. A tax on investment income would reduce the returns from the intermediary thus reducing the life-time expected benefit from the intermediary and could counteract the intended effect of subsidy, which is the earlier joining to the intermediary."
